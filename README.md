# What I learned
When I started this project I knew so little about web development. I learned a lot of things with this particular project.
It teached me 
-> MVC architecture and API development with Laravel
-> How to implement knew technologies and use them in the same project
-> Using Blade, Livewire, Vue, Bootstrap for frontend
-> Working with databases and seeing what suits my needs
-> Getting to know a programming language with a long lasting project
-> Finding mistakes of my past self and fix them in the go

# What can be improved
Towards the end of the project I got bored and wanted to pass on to different projects on my list but I still had some features that I wanted to implement so I just wrote them in the most simplist way without thinking about details and spesifically the frontend. Frontend in direct messaging page can be improved and I figured couple of problems with reactive components.
